The Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a fully managed Kubernetes service for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications on Azure.

In this tutorial, you will deploy a 2 node AKS cluster on your default VPC using Terraform then access its Kubernetes dashboard.

~> **Warning!** If you're not using an account that qualifies under the Azure
[free tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/), you may be charged to run these
examples. The most you should be charged should only be a few dollars, but
we're not responsible for any charges that may incur.

### Why deploy with Terraform?

While you could use the built-in Azure provisioning processes (UI, CLI) for AKS clusters, Terraform provides you with several benefits:

- **Unified Workflow** - If you are already deploying infrastructure to Azure with Terraform, your AKS cluster can fit into that workflow. You can also deploy applications into your AKS cluster using Terraform.

- **Full Lifecycle Management** - Terraform doesn't only create resources, it updates, and deletes tracked resources without requiring you to inspect the API to identify those resources.

- **Graph of Relationships** - Terraform understands dependency relationships between resources. For example, an Azure Kubernetes cluster needs to be associated with a resource group, Terraform won't attempt to create the cluster if the resource group failed to create.

## Prerequisites

The tutorial assumes some basic familiarity with Kubernetes and `kubectl` but does
not assume any pre-existing deployment.

It also assumes that you are familiar with the usual Terraform plan/apply
workflow. If you're new to Terraform itself, refer first to the Getting Started
[tutorial](/terraform/tutorials/azure-get-started).

For this tutorial, you will need

- an [Azure account](https://portal.azure.com/#home)
- a configured Azure CLI
- `kubectl`

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Configured Azure CLI">

In order for Terraform to run operations on your behalf, you must install and
configure the Azure CLI tool. To install the Azure CLI, follow
[these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) or choose a package manager based on your operating system.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="macOS install with Homebrew" group="mac">


You can also use the package manager [`homebrew`](https://formulae.brew.sh/) to install the Azure CLI.

```shell-session
$ brew install azure-cli
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Windows install with Chocolatey" group="windows">


You can also use the package manager [`Chocolatey`](https://chocolatey.org/) to install the Azure CLI.

```shell-session
$ choco install azure-cli
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>


After you've installed the Azure CLI, login into Azure by running:

```shell-session
$ az login
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="kubectl">


To install the `kubectl` (Kubernetes CLI), follow [these instructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) or choose a package manager based on your operating system.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="macOS install with Homebrew" group="mac">


Use the package manager [`homebrew`](https://formulae.brew.sh/) to install `kubectl`.

## Set up and initialize your Terraform workspace

In your terminal, clone the [following repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-terraform-provision-aks-cluster).
It contains the example configuration used in this tutorial.

```shell-session
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-terraform-provision-aks-cluster
```

You can explore this repository by changing directories or navigating in your UI.

```shell-session
$ cd learn-terraform-provision-aks-cluster
```

In here, you will find three files used to provision the AKS cluster.

1. [`aks-cluster.tf`](https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-terraform-provision-aks-cluster/blob/main/aks-cluster.tf) provisions a
   resource group and an AKS cluster. The `default_node_pool` defines the
   number of VMs and the VM type the cluster uses.

   ```hcl
   resource "azurerm_kubernetes_cluster" "default" {
     name                = "${random_pet.prefix.id}-aks"
     location            = azurerm_resource_group.default.location
     resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.default.name
     dns_prefix          = "${random_pet.prefix.id}-k8s"

     default_node_pool {
       name            = "default"
       node_count      = 2
       vm_size         = "Standard_B2s"
       os_disk_size_gb = 30
     }

     service_principal {
       client_id     = var.appId
       client_secret = var.password
     }

     role_based_access_control_enabled = true

     tags = {
       environment = "Demo"
     }
   }
   ```

1. [`variables.tf`](https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-terraform-provision-aks-cluster/blob/main/variables.tf) declares the `appID` and `password` so Terraform can use reference its configuration

1. [`terraform.tfvars`](https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-terraform-provision-aks-cluster/blob/main/terraform.tfvars) defines the `appId` and `password` variables to authenticate to Azure

1. [`outputs.tf`](https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-terraform-provision-aks-cluster/blob/main/outputs.tf) declares values that can be useful to interact with your AKS cluster

1. [`versions.tf`](https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-terraform-provision-aks-cluster/blob/main/versions.tf) sets the Terraform version to at least 0.14 and defines the [`required_provider`](/terraform/language/providers/requirements#requiring-providers) block

### Create an Active Directory service principal account

There are many ways to authenticate to the Azure provider. In this tutorial, you
will use an Active Directory service principal account. You can learn how to
authenticate using a different method [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs#authenticating-to-azure).

First, you need to create an Active Directory service principal account using
the Azure CLI. You should see something like the following.

```shell-session
$ az ad sp create-for-rbac --skip-assignment
{
  "appId": "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa",
  "displayName": "azure-cli-2019-04-11-00-46-05",
  "name": "http://azure-cli-2019-04-11-00-46-05",
  "password": "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa",
  "tenant": "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa"
}
```

### Update your `terraform.tfvars` file

Replace the values in your `terraform.tfvars` file with your `appId` and
`password`. Terraform will use these values to authenticate to Azure before
provisioning your resources. Your `terraform.tfvars` file should look like the
following.

```plaintext
# terraform.tfvars
appId    = "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa"
password = "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa"
```

### Initialize Terraform

After you have saved your customized variables file, initialize your Terraform
workspace, which will download the provider and initialize it with the values
provided in your `terraform.tfvars` file.

```shell-session
$ terraform init
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/random from the dependency lock file
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/azurerm from the dependency lock file
- Installing hashicorp/random v3.0.0...
- Installed hashicorp/random v3.0.0 (signed by HashiCorp)
- Installing hashicorp/azurerm v3.0.2...
- Installed hashicorp/azurerm v3.0.2 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

## Provision the AKS cluster

In your initialized directory, run `terraform apply` and review the planned actions.
Your terminal output should indicate the plan is running and what resources will be created.

```shell-session
$ terraform apply
An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  ## ...

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

  ## ...
```

You can see this terraform apply will provision an Azure resource group and an
AKS cluster. Confirm the apply with a `yes`.

This process should take approximately 5 minutes. Upon successful application,
your terminal prints the outputs defined in `aks-cluster.tf`.

```plaintext hideClipboard
Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

kubernetes_cluster_name = light-eagle-aks
resource_group_name = light-eagle-rg
```

## Configure kubectl

Now that you've provisioned your AKS cluster, you need to configure `kubectl`.

Run the following command to retrieve the access credentials for your cluster
and automatically configure `kubectl`.

```shell-session
$ az aks get-credentials --resource-group $(terraform output -raw resource_group_name) --name $(terraform output -raw kubernetes_cluster_name)
Merged "light-eagle-aks" as current context in /Users/dos/.kube/config
```

The [resource group name](https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-terraform-provision-aks-cluster/blob/main/outputs.tf#L1)
and [Kubernetes Cluster name](https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-terraform-provision-aks-cluster/blob/main/outputs.tf#L5)
correspond to the output variables showed after the successful Terraform run.

## Access Kubernetes Dashboard

To verify that your cluster's configuration, visit
the Azure Portal's Kubernetes resource view.
[Azure recommends](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-dashboard#start-the-kubernetes-dashboard)
using this view over the default Kubernetes dashboard, since the AKS dashboard
add-on is deprecated for Kubernetes versions 1.19+.

Run the following command to generate the Azure portal link.

```shell-session
$ az aks browse --resource-group $(terraform output -raw resource_group_name) --name $(terraform output -raw kubernetes_cluster_name)
Kubernetes resources view on https://portal.azure.com/#resource/subscriptions/aaaaa/resourceGroups/light-eagle-rg/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/light-eagle-aks/workloads
```

Go to the URL in your preferred browser to view the Kubernetes resource view.

## Clean up your workspace

Congratulations, you have provisioned an AKS cluster, configured `kubectl`,
and visited the Kubernetes dashboard.

If you'd like to learn how to manage your AKS cluster using the Terraform
Kubernetes Provider, leave your cluster running and continue to the
[Kubernetes provider tutorial](/terraform/tutorials/kubernetes/kubernetes-provider).

~> **Note:** This directory is **only** used to provision a AKS cluster with Terraform.
By keeping the Terraform configuration for provisioning a Kubernetes cluster and
managing a Kubernetes cluster resources separate, changes in one repository don't
affect the other. In addition, the modularity makes the configuration more
readable and enables you to scope different permissions to each workspace.

If not, remember to destroy any resources you create once you are done with this
tutorial. Run the `destroy` command and confirm with `yes` in your terminal.

```shell-session
$ terraform destroy
```
