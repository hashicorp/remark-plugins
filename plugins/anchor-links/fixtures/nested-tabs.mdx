# Heading One

This is some content sampled because it contains interesting tab nesting.

## Prerequisites

The tutorial assumes some basic familiarity with Kubernetes and `kubectl` but does
not assume any pre-existing deployment.

It also assumes that you are familiar with the usual Terraform plan/apply
workflow. If you're new to Terraform itself, refer first to the Getting Started
[tutorial](/terraform/tutorials/azure-get-started).

For this tutorial, you will need

- an [Azure account](https://portal.azure.com/#home)
- a configured Azure CLI
- `kubectl`

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Configured Azure CLI">

In order for Terraform to run operations on your behalf, you must install and
configure the Azure CLI tool. To install the Azure CLI, follow
[these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) or choose a package manager based on your operating system.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="macOS install with Homebrew" group="mac">

You can also use the package manager [`homebrew`](https://formulae.brew.sh/) to install the Azure CLI.

```shell-session
$ brew install azure-cli
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Windows install with Chocolatey" group="windows">

You can also use the package manager [`Chocolatey`](https://chocolatey.org/) to install the Azure CLI.

```shell-session
$ choco install azure-cli
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

After you've installed the Azure CLI, login into Azure by running:

```shell-session
$ az login
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="kubectl">

To install the `kubectl` (Kubernetes CLI), follow [these instructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) or choose a package manager based on your operating system.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="macOS install with Homebrew" group="mac">

Use the package manager [`homebrew`](https://formulae.brew.sh/) to install `kubectl`.

```shell-session
$ brew install kubernetes-cli
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Windows install with Chocolatey" group="windows">

Use the package manager [`Chocolatey`](https://chocolatey.org/) to install `kubectl`.

```shell-session
$ choco install kubernetes-cli
```
